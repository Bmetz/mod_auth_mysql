You'll need to have the development libraries and include files for both
MySQL and Apache.  Both should be found automatically if they're installed
somewhere reasonable, but otherwise, specify the location using the
--with-mysql-includes, --with-mysql-libs, and --with-apxs options to
configure (see ./configure --help for more information).

Once configure has run successfully, you should be able to type 'make &&
make install' for a happy installation.

See USAGE for information on how exactly to use this beast.
