Non Maintainer Upload of this Package
-------------------------------------

If you plan to work on an NMU for this package, read the following
closely.  It can save you and me some grief.

 1. At first, contact the maintainer (i.e. send a mail to
    joey@debian.org, do not cc or bounce a mail, send a plain mail,
    not copied to any mailing list or the BTS) and ask about the
    status of the bug you are considering to work on.

 2. In this mail include all information relevant for this problem,
    i.e. include a description of the bug and not only its bug
    number.

 3. If the maintainer is not able or willing to fix the problem or
    does not respond within four days, continue with step 4.

 4. Work on the bug and prepare a patch.  Do not upload into the
    Debian archive.

 5. Send the entire patch, together with enough explanations, to the
    maintainer for reviewing and ask him for permission of an NMU
    using this patch.

 6. IF AND ONLY IF the maintainer approves the patch (or doesn't
    respond within four days), upload the NMU to the incoming
    directory and send the patch to the BTS.  If the NMU is not
    approved, go back to 4. or add the NMU to your homepage, but do
    not upload it to the Debian archive.

 7. Properly sized and well-written patches sent to the BTS are always
    appreciated, even if they are rejected later.  They demonstrate a
    potential solution which could probably improved into a real
    solution.

 8. NEVER change the way a package is maintained in an NMU, i.e. don't
    remove dh_* stuff or switch to dh_* respectively.  This rule
    applies to all NMU's, not only to an NMU for this package.

These rules always apply.  They even apply if somebody declares NMUs
as ok and reduces regular NMU rules to a delay of zero days.  Unless
I'm on vacation or on a show I am reachable via mail, so there is
hardly a reason not to contact me.
