libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.3.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now converted to a non-native package, as I've got a user who is not a
    Debianite.
  * Fixed the configure script to properly detect whether libcrypt needs to
    be a separate library.
  * Guarded all instances of CRYPT_DES_ENCRYPTION_FLAG, so you can build the
    module without crypt() being present.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Nov 2004 22:07:14 +1100

    comprehensive testing...) Closes: #267354.
  * Bumped the apache2-*-dev build-dep and apache2 dep to >= 2.0.50-10.

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really fixed the multi-group checking.  Seems I put the "you're not
    invited" return at the wrong scope.  Where's my dwim() function, dammit.
    Closes: #257879 (I promise).

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Aug 2004 00:23:02 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed multi-group checking; if multiple groups are listed in the
    'require group' directive, the code only checked for the first one.
    Thanks to Karsten Richter for finding the bug and fixing it.
    Closes: #257879.
  * Cleaned up a define and associated bits to allow compilation under
    gcc-2.95.  And we didn't even need a versioned build-depends.
    Closes: #258030.

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Determined that safe_mysql_query() wasn't retrying on some retryable
    errors, and fixed it up so that it retries once if the server wandered
    off before we started.  Closes: #255985.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Jun 2004 21:34:59 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Two new directives, Auth_MySQL_DefaultPort and Auth_MySQL_DefaultSocket. 
  * Related to the above, the specification of port or socket as part of the
    hostname is no longer permitted.  Hopefully nobody got too attached to
    that, as it wasn't documented as such anyway.
  * Straightened out various bits of twisty code.
  * Removed the crazy host/port/socket parsing code which (I believe) was
    causing all the screwed up hostname grief.  Closes: #251704.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Jun 2004 17:39:10 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added some directives to the Apache2 config handler which were somehow
    missed in the initial conversion.  Closes: #252455.
  * Fixed a string termination issue in the connection code.
    Closes: #251704.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Jun 2004 10:28:21 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from Takeshi Murakami to add Apache 2 support and the
    ability to specify a port number or socket file (for those times you
    just gotta do it).  Closes: #231667.  Many thanks to Takeshi for taking
    the time to do the Apache2 conversion (which appears to have been a fair
    bit of work).
      - Updated DIRECTIVES for the new port/socket specifiers.
      - Added new --with-apache and --with-apache2 ./configure options to
        enable/disable build support for both modules.
      - New binary package, libapache2-mod-auth-mysql, to provide the
        apache2-compiled version of m-a-m.  Closes: #248415.  Also updated
        build-deps and all that sort of thing.  Small parts shamelessly
        stolen from libapache2-mod-auth-pgsql.
  * Bumped standards version; no changes needed.
  * Reversed the sense of the persistent check on connection close; the
    program now behaves like it's documentation.  Closes: #243995.

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added conditionals and more calls to modules-config so that the module
    will install nicely into all apache flavours.  Closes: #226425.
  * Applied a functionality improvement from Jakub Stachowski to add some
    arbitrary SQL to the end of a query, to improve matching.
    Closes: #221923.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Jan 2004 12:47:46 +1030

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a postinst and postrm which should add and remove the module from
    Apache's module list.  Closes: #220239
  * Thwap!  Forgot that sec->user_field might be NULL, so we shouldn't set
    auth_user_field to it if it's empty.
  * Added more ways to set user_group_field in the group checking query.
    Also added a default, so it'll never be NULL.
  * Some punctuation changes in the group check query string.
  * Tracked down a particularly vicious segfault (and fixed another bug in
    the process).
  * Finally tracked down the cause of require groups not working.
    Closes: #216859.  Many thanks to Stephen Leclerc for putting up with my
    many fruitless debugging attempts, since I couldn't reproduce the
    problem on my systems, but it was consistent for him.

    lambs.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Fri, 16 May 2003 17:37:15 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * USAGE a little more detailed on the subject of encryption types. 
    (Closes: #192098)

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Wed,  7 May 2003 17:18:17 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the Build-Deps to point to the LGPL'd libmysqlclient10-dev,
    rather than the GPL'd libmysqlclient-dev (which is actually lmc12-dev
    now).  Pesky licenses.  Closes: #189212.

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

    distclean in debian/rules.  Closes: #189107.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Apr 2003 09:09:58 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version numbering scheme.  Screw this upstream-debian thing, I *am*
    the damn upstream (oooh, I love the power).
  * Fixed the blasted zombie connection problem.  Simple really - as long as
    Apache played ball (which it didn't).  Closes: #184443.  Yippee!  Much
    thanks *must* go to john@pensol.com who did the hard work of identifying
    the exact circumstances under which this bug occured, and provided a
    fair bit of the logic required to fix it.
  * Added analogous Auth_MySQL_Group_User_Field command, fixed code to align
    with documentation (group_user is the same as the username field, by
    default).  All together, Closes: #187678.

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Apr 2003 23:27:08 +1000

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the custom APLOG_MARK I defined - it really isn't necessary, and
    just makes the logfile uglier.
  * Uncommented the check to see if the module has been disabled in config.
    Another one of those "WTF?" moments.  (Closes: #166458)
  * Hunted down all error messages which don't involve errno and explicitly
    set errno to 0 (to avoid weird errors in logging messages).

 -- Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Nov 2002 15:24:27 +1100

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    ever got commented in the first place is completely beyond me.
    (Closes: #164321)

libapache-mod-auth-mysql (4.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Mostly just a merge of two differing versions of
    the upstream software, as well as some minor fiddling.
