An older version of this package was packaged for Debian GNU/Linux by
Matthew Wilcox <willy@debian.org>, based on code from the Sourceforge
project mod-auth-mysql <http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/>.

Maintenance was taken over by Matthew Palmer <mpalmer@debian.org> in
September 2002 based on two separate forks of mod_auth_mysql that were
derived from code directly included in the Apache source distribution.

The source of the Debian package is managed through CVS.  It is publicly
available at <http://cvs.infodrom.org/mod-auth-mysql/?cvsroot=debian> or
as <:pserver:anonymous@cvs.infodrom.org/var/cvs/debian/mod-auth-mysql/>.
